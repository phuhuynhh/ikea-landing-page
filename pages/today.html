Yet from a sustainability perspective, most jeans produced end up in landfills. That’s why IKEA is now joining hands with the Dutch denim brand MUD Jeans, creating a limited-edition KLIPPAN sofa cover using an innovative method that gives new life to both sofas and worn-out jeans.</p></a>

IKEA co-worker Shin Suzuki did precisely that. He put his heart into creating a combination of rainbow colours and ENEBY speakers to show support for the LGBTQ+ community.
