                            joining hands with the Dutch denim brand MUD Jeans, creating a limited-edition KLIPPAN sofa
                            cover using an innovative method that gives new life to both sofas and worn-out jeans.</p>

                            the LGBTQ+ community. What he created in 2019 will soon be available in IKEA stores for
